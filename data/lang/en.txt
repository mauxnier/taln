Automatic natural language processing (TALN) or automatic language processing (TAL), more commonly known as NLP (from English: natural language processing) is a multidisciplinary field involving linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence, which aims to create natural language processing tools for various applications. It should not be confused with computational linguistics, which aims to understand languages using computational tools.

The TALN came out of research laboratories to be gradually implemented in computer applications requiring the integration of human language into the machine. Also NLP is sometimes called linguistic engineering. In France, automatic natural language processing has its journal, Automatic Language Processing, published by the Association for Automatic Language Processing (ATALA).
